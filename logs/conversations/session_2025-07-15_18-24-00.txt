[LLM] User: i want to know what factory had produced for the brand H&M
[LLM] Bot: H&M (Hennes & Mauritz) is a Swedish multinational fashion corporation that has been known to partner with various suppliers and manufacturers around the world. As a responsible business, H&M has made efforts to increase transparency in their supply chain.

According to publicly available information and reports from organizations like the Clean Clothes Campaign, some of the factories that have produced clothing for H&M include:

1. Rana Plaza (Bangladesh): Unfortunately, this factory collapsed in 2013, resulting in tragic losses. Many international brands, including H&M, had supplied orders to Rana Plaza.
2. Golden Apple Garment Industry Limited (China): This factory has been linked to H&M's production of clothing, particularly activewear and sportswear.
3. Wing Star Ltd. (Cambodia): This Cambodian manufacturer has produced garments for H&M, including knitwear and casual wear.

Please note that these factories may not be exclusively producing for H&M, as many manufacturers supply multiple brands. Additionally, it's essential to recognize that the fashion industry faces various challenges, and ensuring fair labor practices is a continuous effort.
