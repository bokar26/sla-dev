1. What is the style of jeans you want to produce? (e.g., slim fit, skinny, straight leg, boot cut, etc.)
2. Which materials would you like for the fabric and trims? (e.g., 100% cotton, stretch denim, organic cotton, etc.)
3. Do you have any specific color or pattern requirements?
4. What is the minimum order quantity (MOQ) that the manufacturer can produce for your project?
5. Do you require any certifications, such as Oeko-Tex Standard 100, REACH compliance, or GOTS certification?
6. Are there any custom features or details you would like to incorporate into the design of the jeans? (e.g., embroidery, branding, pocket styles, etc.)
7. What is your desired delivery timeline for the completed order?
8. Do you have a budget range for this project?

Once I have these details, I can search my network of pre-screened denim manufacturers and return suitable options for your consideration.
