2. What is your target price range for the denim products?
3. Do you have any specific requirements or certifications for the factory (e.g., Oeko-Tex, ISO 9001, WRAP)?
4. Are there any specific countries or regions you're interested in sourcing from?
5. What is your expected MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) for the denim products?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a list of potential factories that meet your criteria.

In the meantime, here are some popular denim manufacturing destinations:
